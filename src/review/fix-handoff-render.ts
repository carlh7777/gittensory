// Fix-handoff block RENDERER (#2175, render slice of #1962 — the config/gate slice lives in
// src/review/fix-handoff.ts's isFixHandoffEnabled/shouldEmitFixHandoff). Turns a single review finding into a
// structured, machine-readable "apply this fix" block a CONTRIBUTOR'S OWN local coding agent can consume —
// content only, no server-side write, no execution. Mirrors formatInlineBody's severity-label composition
// (inline-comments.ts) and reuses the exact no-cloud-write boundary text every other local-execution artifact
// carries (local-write-tools.ts's LOCAL_WRITE_BOUNDARY), so the guarantee reads identically everywhere
// gittensory hands a contributor something to run themselves.
//
// The caller is responsible for gating emission via shouldEmitFixHandoff (fix-handoff.ts) BEFORE calling into
// this module — this file is pure rendering, public-safe by construction: it only renders fields the caller
// already produced through the public-safe filter (InlineFinding.body/suggestion are sanitized upstream by
// composeInlineFindings before they ever reach here — this module adds no new free text of its own beyond the
// fixed label/marker strings below).
//
// Also renders the AGGREGATE flavor (#5102): buildFixHandoffAggregateBlock combines every finding into ONE
// block for a single agent run over the whole PR, instead of one run per finding — same rendering contract,
// still unwired (see that function's doc comment for why).
